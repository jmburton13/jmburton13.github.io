            <br>
            Take a moment to come up with what it means to you before reading further. Got it?
            Okay. Now think about how that is different than "invention" or "improvement". Is it different? I think so.<br>
            <br>
            Before slinging that word around on LinkedIn etc., I made sure I knew *exactly* what I meant by it.
            To me, innovation is <span class="underline italicized">when you have redefined the purpose of an object or process altogether. </span>
            In the background of this page, you have an amazing view of a few of the vertical forests by Stefano Boeri 
            in Milan, Italy. Stefano and his team took architecture, which exists fundamentally to house people (and exist as art) 
            and redefined it's purpose to include those of a park. Not only do these building literally bring 
            people closer to nature, but it provides a natural horizon most city residents never enjoy, and replaces 
            the horizontal land lost to urbanization with vertical jungles full of living CO2 filters!
